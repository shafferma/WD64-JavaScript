1. Here we require the use of the express npm package that we've installed in our dependencies.
2. We create an instance of express. We're actually firing off a top-level express() function, a function exported by the Express module. This allows us to create an Express app.
3. app.listen will use express to start a UNIX socket and listen for connections on the given path. This method is identical to Nodeâ€™s http.Server.listen().
4. The given path is localhost:3000.
5. We call a callback function when the connection happens with a simple console.log.

1. We import the route object that we just created and store it in a variable called test.
2. We call app.use and in the first parameter create a base url called /test. So our base url will look like this:
http://localhost:3000/test
3. For our second parameter for the use() function, we pass in test. This means that all routes created in the testcontroller.js file will be sub-routes. It will look like this:
http://localhost:3000/test or http://localhost:3000/test/
